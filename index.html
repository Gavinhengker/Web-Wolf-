  <h1>The wolf in sheep's clothing</h1>
</body>
</html>
<p>There was a big wolf. He was waiting for a chance to steal a sheep, but the shepherd and his dog continuously chased him away. After a week, the wolf began to get very hungry, and thought, "I must find a way to get close to the sheep." It was by luck that he found a sheep's skin. He carefully pulled the skin over his body so that none of his grey fur showed under the white sheep skin. Then he could walk in easily and now he was in the middle of the herd.</p>
<p>The big wolf knew that the most delicious sheep were the lambs, or the young sheep. He then imitated the voice of a ewe or a mother sheep. He could easily cheat a lamb who thought that he was its mother. And, the lamb followed him to the woods. There, he eventually ate the innocent lamb. For many days, he could eat as many lambs as his stomach could take. The big wolf got bigger and bigger everyday. Now he looked like the biggest sheep on earth.</p>
<p>One day the shepherd was planning to hold a party. He would invite many relatives and friends. So, he decided to slaughter the biggest sheep from the herd. The shepherd approached the biggest sheep very slowly and carefully. Guess who it was? The wolf, of course, who was fully covered by the white sheep skin! But, the wolf was so fat that he could not run and fight for his safety. Very easily the shepherd slaughtered him, chopped him, and then cooked him for the big party.</p>
